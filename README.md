# Cube Towers / [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkJHDIwPQ9E)

This project was inspired by tweets from [Paul Rickards and Daniel Braun](https://twitter.com/paulrickards/status/1163573261344681991).

Each cube or slab tower is drawn to the height of corresponding Perlin Noise. Using the method is an effective way to simulate elevation and create terrain for graphics projects. 

If you want to run this project yourself, make sure to download [Processing](processing.org). Feel free to reach out to thebuffed@gmail.com if you have any questions.
